# 🌤 What's the Weather?

A React + TypeScript weather app that uses the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to display weather conditions based on the user's geolocation. Users can also select a different location to view the weather. The background dynamically updates based on the current weather (e.g., clouds, snow, clear skies), with hand-drawn visuals created in **Procreate**.
